# Instructions to run application:

1. Download & Install XCode
2. Git clone this repository
3. Create a build and run on any IOS simulator
4. To see widgets in action inoput the query url as the part of plugin configuration, select the desired type of data to be vizualised on top of widgets and boom🎉.  

# Motivation for the project:

With the rise of data anaytlics dashboards and tech behind it was lacking innovation on how data is represented so the idea of showing on-chain data right away on our phone's widget will help the users and  decreases the friction while using such dashboards.

We would like to analyse the data available on chain by creating relations across dapps and chains to create insights.

# Overview for the project:

Our platform allows users to view live feeds from multiple aggregators on NFTs, live updates, and more. Our goal is to provide the information in the most easiest and up-to-date on the widget market with easy to show steps.

Our user-friendly interface allows you to easily search for specific widgets or browse through our catalog. You can also set up alerts to receive push notifications when new widgets become available or when prices change.

Our platform is constantly updating with new information from various aggregators, ensuring you have access to the latest and most accurate information on the widget market.

Join the Widget Place today and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the world of widgets.

# Challenges we ran into

We are using covalent apis to get indexed data but the api latency is extremely high due to which we are unable to do real-time wallet and dapp address analysis and thus had to pivot to csv which allows for faster data analysis with better performance, relations and insights. The data present in the apis is also limited and allows for very less information, insights and analytics to be created. A potential way make analysis easier and better with indexed data is by onboarding individual dapps and currencies to the platform using sub graphs, index that data in our own databaes and create relations and aggregated data on top of that to create better insights.
